To start the build process, you will need to follow these steps:

Check Your Local Setup

Ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your local machine:
Git
Node.js
Firebase CLI
Google Cloud SDK (gcloud CLI)
Any other required SDKs or CLIs (e.g., AdSense SDK, React Native CLI)
Upload Your Project to a Git Repository

Since your files are saved locally at C:\Users\19136\OneDrive\Desktop, you'll first need to upload them to a Git repository. This repository will be monitored by your CI/CD pipeline.
Here’s how to upload your project to GitHub (as an example):

Create a New Repository on GitHub:

Go to GitHub and sign in.
Click the + icon in the top-right corner and select New repository.
Name the repository (e.g., kylie-app).
Choose public or private visibility.
Click Create repository.
Initialize a Git Repository Locally and Push to GitHub: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory:

cd "C:\Users\19136\OneDrive\Desktop"
Initialize a new Git repository, add your files, commit them, and push to GitHub:

git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/kylie-app.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
Configure Google Cloud Services Now that your project is in a GitHub repository, you can configure your Google Cloud services.

Authenticate to Google Cloud: Ensure you are authenticated to Google Cloud:

gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project kylie-3d-avatar-30081
Enable Required APIs:

gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable firebase.googleapis.com
gcloud services enable iam.googleapis.com
Create a Storage Bucket (Optional): If your application requires a Google Cloud Storage bucket:

gsutil mb gs://kylie-3d-avatar-30081-bucket
Setup Cloud Build Triggers

Go to the Cloud Build Triggers page.
Click Create Trigger.
Connect your GitHub repository and configure the trigger to start builds on pushes to the main branch.
Upload and Configure Your cloudbuild.yaml File Ensure your cloudbuild.yaml file is uploaded to your repository. This file will contain the configuration for your Cloud Build pipeline.

Initialize and Configure Firebase If you haven't already, initialize Firebase in your project:

firebase login
firebase init
Run Your Agents In your local environment, create and run the agents you have defined. These agents will handle tasks like setting up IAM roles, integrating AdSense, managing subscriptions, and more.

For Example, Running the Project Initialization Agent:

class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, tasks):
        self.name = name
        self.tasks = tasks

    def run(self):
        for task in self.tasks:
            self.execute_task(task)
        self.next_agent()

    def execute_task(self, task):
        print(f"Executing {task['name']}...")
        task_code = task['code']
        task_code()

    def next_agent(self):
        print(f"{self.name} completed. Notifying the next agent.")

# Define tasks for the project initialization agent
project_initializer_tasks = [
    {'name': 'Authenticate', 'code': lambda: authenticate_gcloud(user_id="kyleh@aitalentsolution.com", password="K2724613h!", organization_id="732661820610", project_id="kylie-3d-avatar-30081")},
    {'name': 'Setup Project Structure', 'code': setup_project_structure}
]

# Initialize and run the agent
project_initializer = Agent("project-initialization-agent", project_initializer_tasks)
project_initializer.run()
Similarly, create and run other required agents.

Monitor Builds and Execute Additional Agents as Needed

Once your initial setup is complete and your agents are running, use the Google Cloud Console to monitor builds and deployments.
Add additional agents for security and cost monitoring, and other tasks.
Summary
The key steps are:

Upload your project to a Git repository like GitHub.
Configure Google Cloud services to support your build and deployment.
Create and run agents to automate configuration tasks and manage your project.
Set up CI/CD pipeline with Cloud Build or other tools.
By following these steps, you will be able to start the build process for the Kylie mobile application effectively.

User
do i have to use github?

Kylie build Assitant
No, you do not have to use GitHub specifically. There are several other options available for hosting your source code repositories and integrating with Google Cloud for deployment. Here are some alternatives:

GitLab
Bitbucket
Google Cloud Source Repositories
Using GitLab
GitLab is a popular alternative to GitHub that provides similar functionalities and also offers integrated CI/CD.

Create a Repository on GitLab:

Go to GitLab and sign in.
Click the + icon and select New project/repository.
Name the repository (e.g., kylie-app).
Choose visibility level (public/private).
Click Create project.
Clone the Repository and Upload Your Files:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://gitlab.com/your-username/kylie-app.git
cd kylie-app
Add your files, commit, and push:
cp -r "C:\Users\19136\OneDrive\Desktop\*" .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
Set Up GitLab CI/CD:

Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file for configuring GitLab CI/CD pipeline:
image: node:14

stages:
  - build
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
    - gcloud app deploy
Using Bitbucket
Bitbucket by Atlassian also offers repository hosting along with integrated CI/CD.

Create a Repository on Bitbucket:

Go to Bitbucket and sign in.
Click Create repository.
Name the repository and choose workspace.
Select visibility (public/private).
Click Create repository.
Clone the Repository and Upload Your Files:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://bitbucket.org/your-username/kylie-app.git
cd kylie-app
Add your files, commit, and push:
cp -r "C:\Users\19136\OneDrive\Desktop\*" .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin main
Set Up Bitbucket Pipelines:

Create a bitbucket-pipelines.yml file:
image: node:14

pipelines:
  default:
    - step:
        name: Build
        caches:
          - node
        script:
          - npm install
          - npm run build
    - step:
        name: Deploy
        script:
          - pipe: atlassian/google-app-engine-deploy:0.3.1
            variables:
              KEY_FILE: $GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
              PROJECT: "kylie-3d-avatar-30081"
              SUBCOMMAND: "app deploy"
Using Google Cloud Source Repositories
Google Cloud Source Repositories is a fully-featured, scalable, private Git repository storage solution.

Create a Cloud Source Repository:

Go to the Google Cloud Console.
Navigate to Source Repositories.
Click Add repository and select Create new repository.
Name the repository (e.g., kylie-app-repo).
Click Create.
Clone and Set Up the Repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
gcloud source repos clone kylie-app-repo --project=kylie-3d-avatar-30081
cd kylie-app-repo
Add your files, commit, and push:
cp -r "C:\Users\19136\OneDrive\Desktop\*" .
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin master
Configure Cloud Build Trigger:

Go to the Cloud Build Triggers page.
Click Create Trigger.
Select Cloud Source Repositories.
Configure the trigger to start builds on pushes to your repository.
CI/CD Integration with Google Cloud
Regardless of the repository hosting platform you choose, you'll need to integrate it with Google Cloud for CI/CD:

Authentication:

Use service accounts or environment variables to securely manage authentication.
Build Configuration:

Ensure you have a build configuration file (cloudbuild.yaml for Google Cloud, .gitlab-ci.yml for GitLab, bitbucket-pipelines.yml for Bitbucket).
Deployment:

Configure your deployment steps to deploy to Google Cloud App Engine, Firebase, or other services.
Example cloudbuild.yaml for Google Cloud:
steps:
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
    args: ['install']
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/npm'
    args: ['run', 'build']
  - name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/gcloud'
    args: ['app', 'deploy']
images: ['gcr.io/kylie-3d-avatar-30081/kylie-app']
Following these steps, you can start the build and deployment process for the Kylie mobile application using any of these repository hosting platforms.
